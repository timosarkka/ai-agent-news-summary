# AI News Summary Agent

## 1. Introduction

This is a lightweight Python-based AI agent that fetches the latest headlines from any news domain and generates a concise, one-paragraph summary using an LLM. Currently, I'm using **gpt-4.1-nano** for the summarizing. The agentic framework I'm using is **smolagents**.

This repo is a work-in-progress, I will keep adding features as I learn more.

Currently, the tool is in it's first draft version, so the functionality is quite minimal. It asks for a news website domain url from the user (for example, hs.fi, yle.fi, is.fi, bbc.com, nytimes.com or any other major news outlet) and as an output, returns a one paragraph summary of the daily news:
