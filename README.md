# AI Agent for Job Search

This AI Agent automates the job search process. 

As input, it takes a user's CV and desired job titles that the user wants to search and possibly apply for. It then scrapes matching job postings from Indeed that match the requirements, analyzes them and provides a personalized report for the user. Additionally, the agent proposes tweaks and enhancements to the user's CV and drafts a motivation letter that can be used as a basis for the job application.
